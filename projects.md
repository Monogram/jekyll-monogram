### Quick Exit
Like most people in Hong Kong, we all take the MTR to and from work.
When you take the MTR every day to work, you start noticing patterns and
soon enough you memorize exactly where to get on so that when you arrive
at your destination you're right in front of an escalator or elevator.
When you're not going to work though, you quickly feel the pain of
getting off the mtr only to realize your exit is at the complete
opposite side of the station.  So to solve this problem we build Quick
Exit.
